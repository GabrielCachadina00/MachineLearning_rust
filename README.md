# ML in Rust

This is a hobby project aimed at testing Rust and my knowledge of machine learning. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning library in Rust.

**Disclaimer**: This library is not intended for serious use and is purely for fun and educational purposes.

## Functionalities Planned

Currently, the library is in the early stages of development, and there are limited functionalities available. However, here are some functionalities that I plan to add:

- [x] **Activation functions**: I will implement a variety of activation functions commonly used in neural networks, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.

- [ ] **Optimization methods**: I will add various optimization methods to train machine learning models, including stochastic gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop.

- [ ] **Kernel initialization**: I will implement various methods for kernel initialization in neural networks, such as He initialization, Xavier initialization, and random initialization.
    - <s>Zero initialization</s>
    - Random normal initialization
    - <s>Random uniform initialization</s>
    - Xavier/Glorot Initialization
    - Normalized Xavier/Glorot
    - He Uniform Initialization
    - He Normal Initialization
- [ ] **CSV input/output**: I will enable the library to read CSV files containing input and output data for machine learning models.

- [ ] **Model creation and training**: The library will allow users to create machine learning models and train them using various algorithms.

- [ ] **Training stats and saving capabilities**: The library will display training statistics, such as loss and accuracy, during the training process. Additionally, it will allow users to save trained models for future use.

## Contributions

As a hobby project, contributions to this library are not expected.
